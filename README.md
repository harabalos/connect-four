This GAME:
-------
Creates a command-line interface version of the well-known board game Connect-4. It allows for numerous rounds to be played in succession since victory sequences are changed to "*" before disappearing.
As an alternative to starting a brand-new game, it is also possible to save the game in its current state and load it up when the application launches.
The winner is the one with the highest score!
